<p= class=p_box> XENOPHOBIA: dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries. </p>
<p class="o_box">There are two primary types of xenophobia:
Cultural xenophobia: This type involves rejecting objects, traditions, or symbols that are associated with another group or nationality. This can include language, clothing, music, and other traditions associated with the culture.
Immigrant xenophobia: This type involves rejecting people who the xenophobic individual does not believe belongs in the ingroup society. This can involve rejecting people of different religions or nationalities and can lead to persecution, hostility, violence, and even genocide.</p>

<h2 class="template2"> MY EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOL</h2>

<p class="s_box"> What? Speak English! One student before said to me one time during lunch break. I was sitting in the cafteria with couple of other students. During, that time I was on the phone with my mom immediately when I started talking in my native language; Fulani. One student in the group interrupted my call by talking over me and she started making weird noises with her teeth that few of the students that where sitting next to her started laughing. And when I got off of the phone she start by saying; "eeyee you" (with a broken-english accent). I looked at her and she said "you african booty scratcher". I got so mad to the point where me and her started to argue with each other. </p>

  <p class="s_box">Another time, I was by the locker room with one of my classmate. He was telling me about he saw a video of on his phone that had to with African people. He start by telling me he feels so bad for Africa. And that Africa is a poor country and th people over there have no food nor clothes. I interrupted him and I told him that I'm African. And that Africa is not a country is a contient. And not every part of Africa is poor. I told him that Africa has alot of resource and minerals and he has no clue about that he should do his research. When I told him that, he respond by saying," Oh, but you guys climb on trees over there right like the monkeys ?". I was very disturb by the way he spoke to me and just my face expression can speak for it self. I chose to talk to about this specific topic because this ties down to one of the chapters in the book, "Citizen: An American Lyric" written by Claudia Rankine. In page.45 the author makes the reader picture themselves in a sitution where they are on the phone having a coversation with a company manager and agreeing to come into to the office to sign couple forms. And you as the reader you come into the office the following day; you enter the manager sees you and automatically looks at you with a surprise look and he tells you he had no clue that you are a black person. This peice of quote relates to my story when one student decided it was okay to make a joke about my native language and said a bad word to me

<p class="text1">For American-born children of African immigrants, being black and African in America can create tension both at home and among friends.For American children born to African immigrants, balancing two identities - both African and a black American - can be a challenge.The term “African Booty Scratcher” might mean very little to many ethnic groups in the United States, but to young African immigrants in New York City and many other city with a high concentration of African immigrants, it holds meaning that reflects on discrimination they experience from their African-American counterparts. </p>
<p class="n_box">Mostly young people in both groups feel the effect of these terms as they try to find ways of living together in the same communities, going to the same schools, and facing similar prejudices.So the question is can these two groups learn to appreciate their differences, and learn from each other, while building each other up on things that they do have in common? African and African Americans come from different experiences. Their historical trajectories are not similar, yet, they can find commonalities in fighting for both economic and social mobility in their communities. They could learn to appreciate one another. Stand against xenophobia. <a href="https://reimaginingmigration.org/addressing-xenophobia-with-culturally-responsive-schools/?msclkid=be9586f0b37311ec9e15412ebb461e09"> End XENOPHOBIA</a>
